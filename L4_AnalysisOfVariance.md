# Objectives

* Understand when and how to use Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
* Carry out and interpret analysis of variables based on full factorial design (n-way ANOVA)

# Overview of ANOVA methods

* **ANOVA as test of difference** (in group means)
* **Covariance analysis (ANCOVA)**: analysis of variance with an additional (at least) interval scaled independent variable (covariate)
* **ANOVA for complete factorial designs**: analysis of variance with more than one independent nominal scaled variable (factor) $\rightarrow$ also called **n-way analysis of variance**
* **ANOVA using repeated measures**: analysis of variance of several observations per respondent (outline)
* **Multivariate ANOVA (MANOVA)**: analysis of variance for several dependent variables (outline)

## n-way ANOVA

**Full factorial design**:

When the experiment includes observations at all combinations of levels of each factor, it is termed **full factorial**. Factorial experiments are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments.

**Fractional factorial design**:

Full factorial experiments can require many runs. The solution to this problem is to use only a **fraction** of the runs specified by the full factorial design.

* to test the effect of different levels of several factors on a dependent variable
* to test if combinations of the independent variable may have a significant influence on the dependent variable &rarr; **interaction effects** are possible (= the effect of a certain variable will depend on the level of another variable)
